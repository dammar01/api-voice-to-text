# Voice to Text API with Vosk

This API application allows users to upload audio files and convert them into text using Vosk, a speech recognition library.

## Features

- Upload audio files in various formats (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- Convert audio to text using the Vosk model
- Supports authentication through headers

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. [Follow the installation guide for Docker here.](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **FFmpeg**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed for converting audio formats. If using Docker, FFmpeg is already included in the image used.
- **.env File**: Copy .env.example to .env and input your backend API_KEY. This API_KEY is used to restrict access to the application, ensuring that it can only be accessed from authorized servers (You can use custom generated API key or random text).

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dammar01/api-voice-to-text.git

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 5. Access the API

using postman or

```bash

-H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY" \
-F "file=@path_to_your_audio_file"
```

## Using Docker

### 1. Pull from docker hub

```bash
docker pull dmmrs/api-voice-to-text:latest
```

### 2. Run images

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY dmmrs/api-voice-to-text:latest
```

### 3. Access the API

using Postman or cURL

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000 \
-H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY" \

## Change Model Vosk

To replace the default Vosk model with your custom model, follow these steps:

### 1. Download the Vosk Model

Visit the [Vosk model repository](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) and choose the model that fits your needs. Download and extract the model files.

### 2. Replace the Existing Model

After extracting the model files, you will have a folder named after the model, e.g., vosk-model-en-us-daanzu-20200905. Rename this folder to vosk to match the expected folder name in the application.

### 3. Copy the Model to the Application

Replace the existing vosk model folder inside your application directory at ./app/vosk. You can do this manually by copying the newly downloaded vosk folder into the directory:

```bash
cp -r /path_to_downloaded_model/vosk ./app/vosk
```

This will overwrite the old model files with your new model.
